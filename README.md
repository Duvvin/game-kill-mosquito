Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening everyone, here is a project that i make in my course of web developer
Follow the images to see how was it.

1: The initial page look a start button and the selection of levels of the game
2: The game works like that:
  2.1: In a determined space of time, appears a mosquito in the screen.
  2.2: You need click on mosquito to kill him
  2.3: If you dont click on mosquito before of him disappear, you lost one life.
  2.4: If you lost 3 lifes before the time finish, you lose.
3: Depending if you win or lose, send you a other screen, showing "Game Over" or "Voce Venceu/You Win", with a button "Restart", to you back to the initial page.
