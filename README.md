## 🎮 About the Project
Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone!  
This is a simple web game I created during my **Web Developer Course**.

## 🚀 How the Game Works

1️⃣ **Initial Page**  
The first screen shows a **Start** button and lets you select the **difficulty level** of the game.

2️⃣ **Gameplay**  
- Every few seconds, a **mosquito** appears randomly on the screen.  
- You must **click the mosquito** to kill it.  
- If you don’t click it before it disappears, you **lose one life**.  
- If you lose **three lives** before the timer ends, you **lose the game**.

3️⃣ **End of the Game**  
Depending on your performance:
- If you lose, a **“Game Over”** screen appears.  
- If you win, a **“You Win / Você Venceu”** screen appears.  

Each final screen includes a **Restart** button to go back to the initial page.
